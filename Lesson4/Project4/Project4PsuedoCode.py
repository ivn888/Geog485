# Create an empty shapefile to store polylines

# Create an empty dictionary to store names of rhinos and their corresponding coordinates

# Open csv

# Read header of csv

# Start loop through rest of csv

    # Pull out lat, lon, name

    # Determine if the dictionary has a key for the rhino name.

    # If no key exists, create a new array object.

    # Create a new point object.

    # Assign the lon reading to the X coordinate of the point.

    # Assign the Y reading to the lat coordinate of the point.

    # Add the point to the array.

    # Add the array to the dictionary using the rhino name as the key.

# Loop through each key of the dictionary
    
    # Write the points to the feature class as a polygon feature with a name field

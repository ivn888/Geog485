- Contour.py - This script uses the Contour tool in the Spatial Analyst toolbox to create contour lines for the Fox Lake Quadrangle shapefile. The contour intervals are 25 meters and the base contour is 0. This corresponds to Project 1 Part 2.

- Buffer.py - This script runs the Buffer tool. The user supplies the input and output paths, and the buffer distance. This corresponds to example 1.6.4.

- CopyShapefile.py - Create copies of a template shapefile. Essentially this script copies the attribute schema of the 2008 shapefile, but not the data points themselves. The data would be populated by another script
